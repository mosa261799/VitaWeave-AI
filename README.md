# 🌱 VitaWeave AI  
### A Content-Based Health & Lifestyle Recommendation Engine

VitaWeave AI is a machine learning–based system that transforms basic health and lifestyle inputs into a **Lifestyle Score (0–10)** and delivers **personalized, actionable recommendations** for overall well-being.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Health data such as BMI, workout frequency, hydration, and diet is often scattered and hard to interpret.  
VitaWeave AI bridges this gap by converting raw health metrics into meaningful insights and guidance.

## 🧠 Approach
- Built a **content-based recommendation system**
- Engineered a **Lifestyle Score** using health indicators
- Trained a **Random Forest Regressor** on structured health data
- Generated recommendations across:
  - 🏋️ Workout
  - 🥗 Nutrition
  - 😴 Recovery
  - 📘 Health Education

---

## 📊 Dataset
- File: `Final_data.csv`
- Features include Age, Gender, BMI, Fat %, Workout Frequency, Water Intake, and Meal Frequency
- Cleaned and preprocessed for reliable training

---

## 📈 Results
